We were asked to answer a series of questions about the mass production of ammonia in a chemical plant. Those questions were:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item what are the quantities of nitrogen and hydrogen needed to produce $\unit{1000}{\ton}$ of ammonia per day?
 \item what is the flow rate of water necessary to maintain the reaction at $\unit{500}{\kelvin}$, knowing that the water enters the reactor at $\unit{25}{\celsius}$ and leaves at  $\unit{90}{\celsius}$?
 \item how are the nitrogen and hydrogen used in the reaction going to be produced?
\end{enumerate}
